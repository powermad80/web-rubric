## Justification
As the lead developer, most of my hours were spent on major design considerations and implementations of the web app functionality. The Rubric Editor and Grade Students views took notably more time than other components due to being the first ones created and containing the most complex components (several of which were reused with modifications in the other views, simplifying development for them). The structure of React.js projects necessitated data structure considerations and planning to be determined and solidified before any UI could be functional and presentable, adding to the time and tasks each view took to create. Design and data structure obstacles arose during development which required multiple attempts and reworks at implementation, sometimes leading to several days of development working on making certain views functional. I had a role in project documentation mostly when it was optimal for the lead developer to do so, such as my experience in test design and execution during my co-ops making me fit for the task of writing the project test plan. A small amount of video editing knowledge also made me fit to piece together the collaboratively made presentation video. Other obstacles included externalities such as difficulties accessing Canvas API leading to determinations regarding the extent to integrate it into the project.
