## Senior Design 
### Assignment #6 Self-Assesment

##### Part A:
For our senior design project, I primarily handled the project management and some back-end side of the project.

I was responsible for outlining and establishing project requirements based on the project idea presented by our project advisor, ensuring that us, the team members, are always in-sync with the project advisor's expectations regarding the project and its periodic progress, setting goals and deadlines as per the project requirements with the team and ensuring satisfactory project progress.

Using the .NET framework experience that I gained through my co-ops, I helped my teammate in designing the back-end structure of our RubricFill web application and developing various features that served as a requirement for this project.

From my responsibilities towards this project, I learned a lot about different aspects of project management and development using .NET framework, especially how to structure such projects when is being built from ground-up. One crucial thing I learned about project management is that it comprehensive and covers components of SDLC like testing and quality as well.

Being able to manage working on our senior design project with load from other classes this semester has been a success. Integrating our web application with UC Canvas to retrieve student data was a significant obstacle we faced with this project.

##### Part B:
We were successfully able to develop a web application that UC instructors will be able to use to grade and manage student' senior design grades. Transparency is the key to be successful in a group. Being transparent with the team members helps build trust which in turn allows for better project management. For our group, transparency has been significant and has contributed to the success of our teamwork. Irregular communication was one aspect of our teamwork that was not successful.

For this project, my efforts on the technical side have been primarily guided by my teammate. I have focused more on brainstorming and managing the project while she her focus has largely been on designing and implementation of the project.

Hannah Dubusker, the only other team member, gave a life to this project with her exceptional efforts while enabling me to better understand the technologies used and help me skillfully use them towards the project.
