## Major Constraints
#### Economic Cost
* While the project can be built entirely with free and open source tools, frameworks, and libraries, the nature of designing a web application means eventually the cost of server hosting will arise. This may not necessarily be a large expense depending on use and traffic to the web app, but it is one that exists.
#### Scope
* There is some room for argument among our group and advisor on the exact scope of this project, how far tools should extend to professors and students. 
#### Professional/Technical
* Members of our group may be confident in their abilities, but every major project contains its unexpected challenges, and it is possible that significant challenges may arise in technical implementation of concepts agreed to be within the scope of the project.
#### Security
* As this web application handles student and professor info regarding class details, project submissions, and grading, security concerns must be taken into account. Secure authentication and storage of sensitive data must be handled with great care and within modern standards.
